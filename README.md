# The Odin Project HTML Recipe Project

This is a basic HTML website. Following the Odin project lists.

The basic design of just HTML provides a very retro feel to early internet.

Overall, this was a good practice of writing HTML pages even if the website looks awful.

Additonal: Following the additional CSS practice the website looks somewhat better, still awful, but clearly demonstrates the benefits of CSS.
